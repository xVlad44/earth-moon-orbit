# 🌍 Earth Orbit 3D Simulator

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the Earth Orbit 3D Simulator! This is a fun, interactive web app that lets you watch the Earth orbit the Sun (in a realistic ellipse!) and see the Moon doing its thing around the Earth. It’s all rendered in 3D using Three.js, so you can zoom, pan, and spin around the solar system like a cosmic explorer.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?
- **Realistic elliptical orbit** for Earth (not just a boring circle!)
- **Moon orbiting Earth** (with physics, but tweaked so it looks cool and doesn’t fly off)
- **Sun, Earth, and Moon** all to scale (well, kinda – some things are exaggerated so you can actually see them)
- **Trails** to show the paths of Earth and Moon
- **Labels and tooltips** for quick facts
- **Speed controls** and pause/resume
- **Starry background** for that deep space vibe

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.** That’s it! No build steps, no installs. Just double-click and go.
2. **Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan.**
3. **Use the on-screen controls** to pause, change speed, show/hide trails, and toggle labels.
4. **Hover over the Sun, Earth, or Moon** for quick facts.

## ⚙️ How It Works (in plain English)
- The Earth’s path is calculated using real orbital math (Kepler’s laws), so it’s an actual ellipse.
- The Moon orbits the Earth using a simplified gravity formula (but we made the orbit bigger so you can see it).
- The Sun just chills in the middle, shining bright.
- Everything is scaled so you can see what’s going on, but it’s not 100% to real-life size (otherwise the Moon would be a pixel!).

## 📝 Files
- `index.html` – The main web page
- `main.js` – All the 3D magic and physics
- `style.css` – Makes it look nice

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stuff
- Built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- No frameworks, no dependencies, just plain HTML/JS/CSS

## 💡 Tips
- If you get lost in space, hit refresh!
- Trails can slow things down on old computers – turn them off if it gets laggy.
- Want to tweak the simulation? Open `main.js` and play around!

## 🌟 Have Fun!
This is just a cool way to see how our little corner of the universe moves. Enjoy exploring!
